# To-Do List App

A simple **To-Do List web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, while saving all data in the browser’s **localStorage** so tasks remain available even after refreshing or reopening the website.

## 🌟 Features

- 📝 Add new tasks using input field
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (disable task by checking it)
- ❌ Delete tasks using delete icon
- 💾 Tasks are saved in **browser localStorage**
- 🔁 Data persists even after page refresh or browser restart
- 🚫 Tasks are removed only when localStorage/browser cache is cleared
- 🎨 Simple and clean UI

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the app  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – App logic and localStorage handling  

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a task in the input field
2. Task is added to the list
3. Task data is stored in **localStorage**
4. User can:
   - ✔️ Check a task to mark it completed
   - ❌ Delete a task using the delete icon
5. When the user revisits the website:
   - All saved tasks appear again automatically
